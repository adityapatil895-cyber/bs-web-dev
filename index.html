        <h1>SUPERMAN</h1>
        <p>Superman is a superhero created by writer Jerry Siegel and artist Joe Shuster, first appearing in issue #1 of
            Action Comics, published in the United States on April 18, 1938.[1] Superman has been regularly published in
            American comic books since then, and has been adapted to other media including radio serials, novels, films,
            television shows, theater, and video games. Superman is the archetypal superhero: he wears an outlandish
            costume, uses a codename, and fights evil and averts disasters with the aid of extraordinary abilities.
            Although there are earlier characters who arguably fit this definition, it was Superman who popularized the
            superhero genre and established its conventions. He was the best-selling superhero in American comic books
            up until the 1980s;[2] it is also the best-selling comic book series in the world with 600 million copies
            sold.[3]
